# Econometrics Assignments of 2023Fall, CUHK-Shenzhen
The assignments in the whole semester try to replicate a research paper titled "Property Rights, Land Misallocation and Agricultural Eciency in China" (Chari, Liu, Wang, and Wang, 2021) step by step. 

The paper examines the impact of a property rights reform in rural China that allowed farmers to lease out their land.
They examined the effects of land rental activity in rural households on output and aggregate productivity.

To replicate this paper, we use the main dataset "aghousehold.dta" and load it into Stata. 
The main data we use is the National Fixed Point Survey (NPFS), which is a nationally representative panel dataset (unbalanced) of roughly 20,000 households in 360 villages between 1986 and 2013. 

It is collected by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of China.
